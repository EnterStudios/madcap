### benchmarking

#### ixgbe and raven directory contains setup and pps measurement scripts.

- in ixgbe, test traffic was generated by netdevgen, and transmitted to
  pyhsical through X520.
- in raven, test traffic was generated by netdevgen, and kfree_skb()ed in
  raven_xmit(ndo_start_xmit). so, the results of raven test indicates
  the tunneling performance of linux network stack.


#### how to use.

set up a pseudo interface, generate test traffic and count packet per second.

- run ./set-[driver].sh {noencap|ipip|gre|gretap|vxlan|nsh} {0|1}
 - second argument 0 means no madcap offlaod. 1 means with madcap offload.
- run ./pps-msmt.sh {noencap|ipip|gre|gretap|vxlan|nsh}
 - then, result file 'result-[pktlen]-[proto].txt' appeared in the directory 
   'result-[driver]-w(o)-mc/'.
