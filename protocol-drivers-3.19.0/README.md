## madcap test and evaluation.

### evaluation set-up memo
- 'make OVBENCH=yes' in madcap directory enables timestamping in TX path. This requires modified kernel, https://github.com/upa/linux-madcap-msmt.
- protocol-drivers-3.19.0/reset.sh creates all overlay protocol interfaces. Addresses of all interfaces are assigned for evaluation using OVBENCH and netdevgen.
 - All protocol drivers have module_param 'madcap_enable={0|1}'. 0 means madcap offload is disabled even if underlay device (specified by ip link add type 'dev PHY_DEV') was madcap capable device.
 - In reset.sh, madcap=0 means default TX path (madcap offloading is not enabled). All encapsulated packets are transmited through 'raven0' interface. Packets are dropped, and timestamp values are shown by 'cat /proc/driver/raven'.
 - Timestamping enabled packet is generated by netdevgen through 'echo PROTONAME > /proc/driver/netdevgen'
 - when madcap=1, TX path is offloaded through madcap API, raven interfaces named 'rX-proto'. ToDo: this is not implemented in this commit.
